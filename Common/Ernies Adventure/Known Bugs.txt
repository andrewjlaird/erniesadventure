Known Bugs
WORK AROUND IMPLEMENTED - When cows walk from north east pastures together to the west
they can fall through the fence and end up in the south pasters.
This may be because when they change scenes together they are
on top of each other, and can go over borders.

FIXED - Path objects don't run at start character yet

FIXED - Boundary square doesn't draw on the right place

FIXED - Avoid brain gets erased when edited

Avoid characters get erased when edited

FIXED - When follow characters are placed in game in another scene their sprites get statically placed
on the screen even though it was in another scene.

FIXED - On some scenes when sticky keys are on, ernie stops right
after changing scenes.

FIXED - Can't get fiddle from graham

FIXED - Disable moving while animations are in progress

FIXED - When an avoid character gets up against an angled edge, it will
jump back and forth very fast between one direction and another
possibly implement delay so it's not so fast.

FIXED - When a cow goes back up to the north pasture after being in the south pasture - if it's being pushed against the west gate, it can get "out"

FIXED - Stuck on pumpkin when ernie gives it to laura - double check all items that pop on screen

FIXED - North into pasture up against east most side of gate opening - get stuck once in pasture.

FIXED - Stuck on red tree in bettweenHouseAndBarn - and basketball hoop

FIXED - Don't allow throw at cat before cat comes on screen.

FIXED - Stuck text - more testing required
